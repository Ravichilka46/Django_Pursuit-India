# Django_Pursuit-India
Web Scraping of Covid-19 cases in India(statewise).

In this project we use BeautifulSoup Library in python for parsing the scraped data.

Here we used "Django" Web Framework for creating the website.

For Front-End part we took a help from Bootstrap4 for template design(Tables,Navbar,carousel).
